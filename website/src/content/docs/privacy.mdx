**Last updated:** February 2025

This privacy policy explains how Astro Editor ("we", "us", "our") collects, uses, and protects information when you use our website and desktop application. We are committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent about our data practices.

## Data Controller

Astro Editor is operated by Danny Smith, based in the United Kingdom. For any privacy-related queries, contact [hello@danny.is](mailto:hello@danny.is).

## Summary

Astro Editor stores all your data locally on your device. We don't collect, store, or transmit your content, projects, or personal information. The only data processing occurs through privacy-friendly website analytics.

## What We Collect

### Website Analytics

This website uses [Simple Analytics](https://simpleanalytics.com/) to understand how visitors use the documentation. Simple Analytics is a privacy-first analytics provider that:

- **Does not use cookies** or similar tracking technologies
- **Does not collect personal data** or IP addresses
- **Does not track individuals** or create user profiles
- **Is fully GDPR, UK GDPR, and PECR compliant** by design
- Stores data on EU-based infrastructure

Because Simple Analytics does not collect personal data or use cookies, no consent banner is required under UK PECR regulations.

The aggregate data collected includes:
- Page views and referral sources
- General geographic region (country level only)
- Device type and browser (non-identifying)

### Desktop App

Astro Editor is a native desktop application that is entirely offline and privacy-respecting:

- All data is stored as local files on your device
- No data is transmitted to external servers
- No usage analytics or telemetry is collected
- No user account or registration is required
- No internet connection is needed to use the app

## Legal Basis for Processing

Under the UK General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR), we rely on **legitimate interests** (Article 6(1)(f)) as our legal basis for processing the limited, non-personal website analytics data. Our legitimate interest is to understand aggregate website usage to improve our documentation and services.

## Data Sharing

We do not sell, trade, or share your personal data with third parties. The only third-party service we use is Simple Analytics for website statistics, which processes only anonymous, aggregate data.

## Data Retention

- **Website analytics**: Aggregate statistics are retained by Simple Analytics for as long as our account is active
- **Local app data**: Stored indefinitely on your device under your control—you can delete it at any time

## Your Rights

Under the UK GDPR, you have the following rights regarding your personal data:

- **Right of access** – Request a copy of data we hold about you
- **Right to rectification** – Request correction of inaccurate data
- **Right to erasure** – Request deletion of your data
- **Right to restrict processing** – Request limitation of how we use your data
- **Right to data portability** – Receive your data in a portable format
- **Right to object** – Object to processing based on legitimate interests
- **Right to withdraw consent** – Where processing is based on consent

Since we collect no personal data through our products and only anonymous aggregate data through website analytics, these rights have limited practical application. However, if you have any concerns, please contact us.

## Cookies

**This website does not use cookies.**

Simple Analytics is specifically designed to work without cookies or any form of local storage that would require consent under UK PECR (Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations 2003).

## Children's Privacy

Our products are not directed at children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal data from children.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated revision date. We encourage you to review this policy periodically.
