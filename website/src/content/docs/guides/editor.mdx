import { Kbd } from 'starlight-kbd/components'

The editor window shows the entire contents of your markdown or MDX files with the exception of the YAML frontmatter and any JSX `import` lines immediately following the frontmatter. It's designed to provide an extremely clean writing interface, especially when both sidebars are closed. It provides markdown syntax highlighting.

## Auto-Save

Astro Editor automatically saves your work while you're editing (configurable in preferences, default is 2 seconds). You'll see a brief "Saved" notification in the status bar when auto-save occurs. You can also manually save at any time using <Kbd mac="Command+S" />.
