A number of "modes" can be toggled while writing/editing, which alter how the editor displays your content. These are generally compatible with each other (they can be toggled on and off independently).

## Focus Mode

Dims everything but the current sentence (or line for lists). Can be toggled with the 👁️ icon in the toolbar.

## Typewriter Mode

Keeps the editor cursor centered vertically in the window and scrolls the document - much like a typewriter.

> [!WARNING]
> This is currently unreliable and could cause the editor window to behave in unexpected ways.

## Copyedit Highlighting

Copyedit mode highlights different parts of speech in your writing with distinct colors, helping you analyze writing patterns and identify areas for improvement.

**Parts of Text Highlighted**:

- **Nouns**: Purple highlighting to identify subjects and objects
- **Verbs**: Blue highlighting to spot action words and tense patterns
- **Adjectives**: Green highlighting to review descriptive language
- **Adverbs**: Orange highlighting to catch potentially unnecessary modifiers
- **Conjunctions**: Red highlighting to see sentence connection patterns

**Individual Controls**: You can toggle highlighting for specific parts of speech using the command palette.

**Smart Exclusions**: Highlighting automatically excludes code blocks and markdown syntax, so only your actual prose is analyzed.

**Writing Use Cases**:

- Spot overuse of adverbs in your writing
- Check for consistent verb tenses
- Review the density of adjectives in descriptions
- Identify complex sentence structures with many conjunctions
