import { Kbd } from 'starlight-kbd/components'

When editing an MDX file, <Kbd mac="Command+/" /> will open the component builder. This will show all the components inside your configured "/components/mdx" directory. You can select a component to insert and toggle the props you want in the next panel. Pressing <Kbd mac="Command+Return" /> will insert the component into your document, where you can tab through the various props.
