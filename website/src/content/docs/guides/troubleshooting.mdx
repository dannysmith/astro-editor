If you're experiencing issues with Astro Editor, you can collect detailed logs to help with troubleshooting.

## Getting Diagnostic Logs

Astro Editor automatically logs detailed information to help diagnose setup problems, crashes, or other issues.

**To collect logs for support:**

**Method 1: Complete Log File (Recommended)**

1. **Open Finder** and navigate to: `~/Library/Logs/is.danny.astroeditor/`
2. **Copy the file** `Astro Editor.log`
3. **Send this file** along with a description of your issue

**Method 2: Console.app for Live Monitoring**

1. **Open Console.app** (Applications > Utilities > Console)
2. **Search for "Astro Editor"** in the search bar
3. **Reproduce the issue** you're experiencing (try opening the project again, etc.)
4. **Filter the results** by typing "Astro Editor" to see only relevant log entries
5. **Select and copy** the relevant log entries
6. **Send the logs** along with a description of your issue

**Note:** The complete log file (Method 1) contains all historical application logs and is usually more helpful for debugging than individual Console.app entries.

**Useful search terms in Console.app:**

- `Astro Editor [PROJECT_SETUP]` - Project opening and setup issues
- `Astro Editor [PROJECT_SCAN]` - Collection and file discovery problems
- `Astro Editor [PROJECT_REGISTRY]` - Project registration and management
- `Astro Editor [PROJECT_DISCOVERY]` - Project metadata detection

The logs contain no personal content - only technical information about file paths, app operations, and error details needed for debugging.
