This is effectively a pre-release of 1.0.0, which will be shipped with no additional features after I've spent some time testing this release.

### This Release

- Users can now choose between Markdown or MDX as the default filetype for new files. This is configurable in the global settings, and can be overridden on a per-project and per-collection basis.
- Files now auto-save every ten seconds regardless of whether the user has stopped typing. This ensures content is written to disk when typing in flow-state. The existing autosave-after-cease-typing functionality still works as before.
- Fixed minor UI inconsistencies.
- Extensive refactoring & performance improvements under-the-hood.
