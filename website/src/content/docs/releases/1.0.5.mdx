**Search & Sort** — Filter your files with the new search bar. Click the filter icon next to any collection to search by filename and customize sorting. Choose from multiple sort options (date, title, filename, etc.) based on your collection's frontmatter fields, with ascending/descending toggle.

**Remember Window Layout** — Astro Editor now remembers your window size and sidebar positions between sessions. Open the app and pick up right where you left off.

**Collection Schema Warnings** — Collections without a defined schema now show a warning indicator, making it easier to spot configuration issues.

**Windows Improvements**

  - Fixed title bar buttons not responding to clicks
  - Added Windows menu (hamburger icon in the title bar)
  - Square corners when maximized/fullscreen (matching Windows conventions)
  - New keyboard shortcuts for Windows users

**Bug Fixes**

  - Sorting improvements - Files without dates now sort alphabetically by title. Files with the same date use an alphabetical tiebreaker, eliminating the previously unpredictable ordering.
  - Draft filtering fix - Fixed an issue where files could incorrectly appear in the Drafts filter.
