### Breaking Changes ⚠️
Generated JSON schemas are now **required** for schema fields to show in the sidebar. While `content.config.json` or `content/config.json` schemas are still parsed, they are now **only** used to enrich the generated JSON schemas. Runnigh `astro sync` or `astro dev` or `astro build` in your Astro project will auto-generate these schemas, so this should not negatively affect many users.

### New Features
- Image and Reference fields now work properly inside nested objects in the schema.

### Technical Improvements & Bugfixes
- Rebuilt simplified Zod schema parser to only handle information which isn't available in the generated JSON schemas. Currently this is Zod `references()` and Astro `image()` fields.
- Simplified logic for handling images and files added to MD/MDX files and/or frontmatter. No change to functionality, but should make this more reliable.
