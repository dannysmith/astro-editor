### Editor Improvements

- Editor typography now changes based on the width of the Editor pane, not the width of the application window.
- New `Cmd + Shift + L` shortcut, which adds a cursor to the end of each line in the currently selected text.
- Markers for inline formatting (eg bold, italic) are now subdued in the same way as other markdown syntax.
- Fenced code blocks now have a distinct background.
- Blockquotes now have more distinct styling.
- Fixed a bug where the editor pane sometimes wouldn't use the correct typeface settings.
- Other minor improvements to editor typography.
