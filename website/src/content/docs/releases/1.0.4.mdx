Untested builds for windows and Linux are included in this build. macOS Users should see no change in behaviour, though there has been significant refactoring under-the-hood to cater for multi-platform support.

If you are encountering new bugs on macOS, please report as usual. If you are a Windows or Linux user, please test the builds out and report any bugs in #56 to begin with. 🙏
