- Schema fields are now read from the JSON files which astro generates rather than directly from the Zod schema. In the event these haven't been generated it will fall back to the old behaviour.
- Constraints (character limits, min/max etc), default values and `.describe()` descriptions are now shown in the UI of the right sidebar.
- Minor bugfixes and technical dependancy updates.
