This is effectively a second pre-release of 1.0.0, which will be shipped with no additional features after I've spent some time testing this release.

### This Release

- Images and files dragged into the editor or added to an image-type frontmatter field now default to relative paths. This can be overridden to use absolute paths (relative to the project root) on a per-project and per-collection basis.
- Extensive refactoring under the hood.
