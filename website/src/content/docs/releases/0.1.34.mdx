This is effectively a third pre-release of 1.0.0, which will be shipped with no additional features after I've spent some time testing this release.

### This Release

- Fixed bug where images added to frontmatter or the editor could result in multiple copies appearing in the Assets directory.
- Removed buggy status bar.
- Under-the-hood performance improvements and refactoring.
