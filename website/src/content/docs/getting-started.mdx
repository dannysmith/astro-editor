Astro Editor is a schema-aware markdown editor for Astro content collections. It reads your Zod schemas and creates intelligent editing interfaces for distraction-free writing.

Documentation is coming soon. In the meantime, check out the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/dannysmith/astro-editor) for more information.
