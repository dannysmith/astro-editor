# Task: Write Documentation Content

Write the actual documentation for the Astro Editor website. Task 1 sets up the Starlight site with stub pages; this task fills them in with real content.

## Context

- The Starlight site structure and stub pages are created in Task 1
- Most content will be written by hand with AI assistance
- New screenshots will be taken to replace/supplement the current ones
- The existing user guide at `docs/user-guide.md` is the starting point for content
- Documentation structure (sidebar, page hierarchy) is defined in Task 1 Phase 4 but can be revised here
