# Task: Complete Homepage Redesign

Rebuild `website/src/pages/index.astro` from scratch as a proper marketing/landing page, replacing the quick port from the old static `index.html`.

## Context

- Task 1 ports the existing homepage content into Astro with minimal changes (keeps Tailwind CDN)
- This task starts fresh: new design, proper use of Astro features (`<Image>`, scoped styles, components), no Tailwind CDN
- Reference the Taskdn homepage (`~/dev/taskdn/website/src/pages/index.astro`) for patterns (Flexoki palette, `light-dark()`, component extraction, accessible animations)
- The standalone `Layout.astro` from Task 1 provides the base HTML shell and Flexoki CSS variables
