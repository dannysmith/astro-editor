A month later, I deleted the accounts entirely. Here's why I did it—and what happened next.\n\n## The Breaking Point\n\nIt wasn't one dramatic moment. It was the accumulated weight of thousands of small moments:\n\n- Reaching for my phone the instant I felt bored\n- Scrolling through Instagram while talking to my partner\n- Feeling inadequate after seeing everyone's highlight reels\n- Losing entire evenings to mindless scrolling\n- Checking notifications obsessively throughout the day\n\nOne morning, I woke up and immediately opened Instagram *before even getting out of bed*. That's when I realized: **I had a problem.**\n\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.\n\n## The Justifications I Told Myself\n\nFor months, I made excuses for why I *couldn't* quit:\n\n> \"I need it for work networking\"\n\nDid I really? Or was that just a convenient excuse?\n\n> \"I'll miss out on important updates from friends\"\n\nThe friends who matter know how to reach me.\n\n> \"I'll be disconnected from current events\"\n\nI can read the news without doomscrolling Twitter.\n\nEvery justification fell apart under scrutiny. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit.\n\n## What Changed\n\nThe first week was hard. I reached for my phone constantly, muscle memory taking over. But then things started to shift:\n\n### Week 1-2: Withdrawal\n- Phantom notification anxiety\n- Boredom I didn't know how to fill\n- FOMO about what I was missing\n\n### Week 3-4: Adjustment\n- Started reading books again\n- Actually *present* in conversations\n- Less comparison and envy\n\n### Month 2-3: Clarity\n- More creative output\n- Better sleep\n- Genuine connections with fewer people\n- *Time*—so much time\n\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.\n\n## What I Learned\n\nSocial media isn't inherently evil, but the business model is toxic. These platforms are *designed* to be addictive. They profit from your attention, and they're very good at taking it.\n\nSome observations:\n\n- **I don't miss it.** Not even a little.\n- **Real friendships** require more effort, but they're deeper\n- **Boredom is valuable**—it's when creativity happens\n- **The world didn't end** when I logged off\n\n## What About Professional Networking?\n\nI was worried about losing professional connections, but it turned out fine. I:\n\n- Updated my website with contact information\n- Joined specific communities (Slack groups, Discord servers)\n- Focused on quality relationships over quantity\n\nThese connections are more intentional and valuable than the shallow \"networking\" I did on social media.\n\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum.\n\n## Should You Quit?\n\nI don't know. Everyone's relationship with social media is different. But if you're reading this and feeling a pang of recognition—if you suspect your usage might be unhealthy—maybe try an experiment:\n\n- [ ] Delete apps from your phone for one week\n- [ ] See how you feel\n- [ ] Notice where you automatically reach for your phone\n- [ ] Pay attention to your mental state\n\nAfter a week, you'll know whether it's worth continuing.\n\nFor me, deleting social media was one of the best decisions I've made for my mental health. I have my attention back. I have my time back. I have *myself* back.\n\nAnd I'm not going back.","src/content/articles/lifestyle/deleted-social-media.md","ea20752bde50c2c8",{"html":389,"metadata":390},"\u003Ch1 id=\"why-i-finally-deleted-social-media\">Why I Finally Deleted Social Media\u003C/h1>\n\u003Cp>Three months ago, I deleted Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook from my phone.

Then I discovered the concept of *slow mornings*, and everything changed.\n\n## What Is a Slow Morning?\n\nA slow morning isn't about having endless time—it's about being **intentional** with the time you have. It means:\n\n- Waking up without immediately reaching for your phone\n- Taking time to actually *taste* your coffee\n- Moving through your morning routine with presence rather than urgency\n- Creating space for activities that nourish you\n\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat.\n\n## My Morning Routine\n\nHere's what my current morning looks like:\n\n1. **6:00 AM** - Wake up naturally (no alarm)\n2. **6:15 AM** - Meditation and stretching\n3. **6:30 AM** - Coffee and journaling\n4. **7:00 AM** - Reading or writing\n5. **7:30 AM** - Breakfast\n6. **8:00 AM** - Start work\n\nThe key is that none of these feel rushed. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur.\n\n### The First Hour\n\nThe first hour after waking is sacred. I don't check email, I don't look at social media, I don't turn on the news. This hour belongs to *me*, not to the world's demands.\n\n## Changes I've Noticed\n\nSince adopting slow mornings three months ago:\n\n- I feel **calmer throughout the day**\n- My productivity has actually *increased*\n- I'm more creative and focused\n- I look forward to mornings instead of dreading them\n\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.\n\n## Tips for Starting\n\nYou don't need to overhaul your entire life. Start small:\n\n- Wake up just **15 minutes earlier**\n- Pick *one* slow activity (meditation, journaling, reading)\n- Keep your phone in another room overnight\n- Prepare what you can the night before\n\nRemember: this isn't about perfection. Some mornings will be rushed, and that's okay. The goal is to make slow mornings the norm rather than the exception.\n\n## The Bigger Picture\n\nIn our culture of hustle and productivity, slow mornings feel almost *rebellious*. But starting your day with intention rather than reaction is one of the most powerful changes you can make.\n\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum.\n\nAs the saying goes: *\"How you do anything is how you do everything.\"* When you start your day slowly and intentionally, that energy carries through your entire day.","src/content/articles/lifestyle/slow-mornings.md","fe18ece787e53903",{"html":513,"metadata":514},"\u003Ch1 id=\"the-art-of-slow-mornings\">The Art of Slow Mornings\u003C/h1>\n\u003Cp>For years, I started every day the same way: jolting awake to an alarm, immediately checking my phone, rushing through breakfast, and arriving at work already stressed.

Before I even opened my eyes, anxiety was already sitting on my chest, making demands.\n\nIf you experience morning anxiety, you're not alone. Here's what's helped me.\n\n## Understanding Morning Anxiety\n\n**Cortisol** (the stress hormone) naturally peaks in the morning—it's what wakes us up. But for some people, this spike triggers anxiety symptoms:\n\n- Racing thoughts\n- Physical tension\n- Sense of dread\n- Difficulty getting out of bed\n\nFor me, it felt like waking up *already behind*, like I'd forgotten something important even though nothing was actually wrong.\n\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.\n\n## What Didn't Work\n\nBefore I found strategies that helped, I tried things that made it worse:\n\n- Immediately checking my phone (hello, information overload)\n- Lying in bed ruminating (amplifies anxious thoughts)\n- Caffeinating heavily (more stress hormones)\n- Rushing through my morning (validates the \"behind\" feeling)\n\n## What Actually Helps\n\n### 1. The 5-Minute Rule\n\nI don't *have* to feel better immediately. I just have to get through the next five minutes. Usually, anxiety peaks within 10-15 minutes of waking, then naturally subsides. Knowing this helps me ride it out.\n\n### 2. Physical Grounding\n\nThe moment I wake up, I do a **body scan**:\n\n- Notice where tension lives (jaw, shoulders, stomach)\n- Take five deep breaths\n- Stretch or do gentle movement\n\nThis interrupts the anxious thought spiral by anchoring me in my body.\n\n### 3. Morning Pages\n\nI write three pages of stream-of-consciousness thoughts. This *externalizes* the anxiety instead of letting it loop in my head. I don't read what I wrote—it's just a brain dump.\n\n### 4. No Phone for the First Hour\n\nThis was hard at first, but it's been transformative. My anxiety feeds on information and urgency. The first hour of my day now belongs to *me*, not to the world's demands.\n\n### 5. Predictable Routine\n\nI do the same things every morning:\n\n- Wake at the same time\n- Drink water\n- Write morning pages\n- Meditate for 10 minutes\n- Make breakfast\n\nThe predictability is calming. My nervous system knows what to expect.\n\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur.\n\n## Progress, Not Perfection\n\nSome mornings I still wake up anxious. But now:\n\n- I *expect* it might happen\n- I have tools to manage it\n- I know it will pass\n- I don't panic about panicking\n\nThe difference between now and two years ago is night and day. Morning anxiety doesn't control my life anymore.\n\n## When to Seek Help\n\nIf morning anxiety is severe or persistent, **talk to a therapist**. These strategies have helped me, but they're not a substitute for professional support. There's no shame in needing help—I've been in therapy for years.\n\n## Final Thoughts\n\nYou don't have to wake up dreading the day. With the right strategies and support, mornings can become peaceful instead of panic-inducing.\n\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

I'd never touched clay before, never used a pottery wheel, and had no idea what I was doing. Today, I have a shelf full of wonky bowls and mugs—and I've learned more than just how to center clay.\n\n## Why Pottery?\n\nHonestly, it was random. I saw a \"[beginner pottery class](https://example.com/pottery)\" poster at a coffee shop and signed up on impulse. I was looking for a creative outlet that didn't involve screens, and pottery seemed... different.\n\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.\n\n## Lesson 1: Failure Is Part of the Process\n\nMy first attempt at throwing a bowl collapsed into a sad, lopsided mess within thirty seconds. My second attempt wasn't much better. Neither was my tenth.\n\nIn pottery, you fail *constantly*. Clay collapses. Rims crack. Handles break off. Pieces explode in the kiln. But here's the thing: **every failure teaches you something**.\n\n### What Pottery Taught Me About Failure:\n\n- Failure isn't personal—it's data\n- You learn more from failures than successes\n- The goal isn't perfection; it's improvement\n- Starting over is often faster than trying to fix mistakes\n\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur.\n\n## Lesson 2: Patience Is a Skill, Not a Personality Trait\n\nI am not a patient person. I want results *now*. But pottery doesn't work that way.\n\nAfter throwing a pot, you must:\n\n1. Let it dry to leather-hard (1-2 days)\n2. Trim and refine it\n3. Let it dry completely (3-5 days)\n4. Bisque fire it (8-10 hours)\n5. Glaze it\n6. Glaze fire it (8-10 hours)\n7. Wait for the kiln to cool (12+ hours)\n\nFrom start to finish, a simple mug takes **two weeks minimum**. You cannot rush it. The clay doesn't care about your deadline.\n\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.\n\n## Lesson 3: The Process Matters More Than the Product\n\nI used to be obsessed with outcomes. If something didn't turn out perfectly, I considered it a waste of time. Pottery has slowly rewired that thinking.\n\n*The process* of centering clay, feeling it take shape under your hands, solving problems as they arise—that's where the value is. The finished mug is just a bonus.\n\n## Lesson 4: Comparison Kills Joy\n\nIn my pottery class, there's a woman who's been throwing for twenty years. Her pots are gorgeous—thin-walled, perfectly symmetrical, with elegant handles. When I first started, I couldn't help comparing my work to hers.\n\nThen my instructor said something that stuck with me: *\"The only comparison that matters is between you today and you last month.\"*\n\nNow I keep my first wonky bowl on my desk as a reminder of how far I've come.\n\n## Lesson 5: Mastery Takes Time (And That's Okay)\n\nPottery has given me a new appreciation for mastery. I watch experienced potters throw a bowl in five minutes—something that takes me thirty minutes and multiple attempts. That gap used to frustrate me.\n\nNow I see it as exciting. I have *years* of growth ahead of me. Every session at the wheel, I get a little better. The journey toward mastery is long, and that's what makes it worthwhile.\n\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

Don't worry about being good at it. Don't worry about your age or your lack of experience.\n\nJust start. Make bad things. Learn. Improve.

I expected beautiful architecture and good food—and it delivered on both—but I wasn't prepared for how *charming* this city is. The hills, the trams, the tiles, the melancholy *fado* music drifting from restaurant windows at night.\n\n## Day 1: Historic Neighborhoods\n\n### Morning: Alfama District\n\nStart in **Alfama**, Lisbon's oldest neighborhood. Get lost (intentionally) in the narrow cobblestone streets. Key spots:\n\n- São Jorge Castle for panoramic views\n- Miradouro de Santa Luzia viewpoint\n- National Pantheon\n\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.\n\n### Afternoon: Baixa and Chiado\n\nTake Tram 28 (yes, it's touristy, but worth it) to the **Baixa** district. Walk through:\n\n1. Praça do Comércio - grand waterfront square\n2. Rua Augusta - pedestrian shopping street\n3. Elevador de Santa Justa - iconic lift with city views\n\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore.\n\n### Evening: Bairro Alto\n\n**Bairro Alto** comes alive at night. Have dinner at a traditional Portuguese restaurant (I recommend trying *bacalhau*—salted cod), then bar hop through the neighborhood's tiny establishments.\n\n## Day 2: Belém and Beyond\n\n### Morning: Belém\n\nTake the tram to **Belém** along the river. Must-sees:\n\n- Jerónimos Monastery (UNESCO World Heritage site)\n- Belém Tower\n- Padrão dos Descobrimentos (Monument to the Discoveries)\n\n**Important**: Stop at Pastéis de Belém for the original *pastel de nata* (custard tart). There will be a line. It's worth it.\n\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.\n\n### Afternoon: LX Factory\n\nHead to **LX Factory**, a hipster creative space in an old industrial complex. Great for:\n\n- Shopping for Portuguese design\n- Lunch at trendy cafés\n- Instagram-worthy bookstores\n\n### Evening: Sunset at Miradouro\n\nEnd your trip watching sunset from one of Lisbon's many **miradouros** (viewpoints). My favorite: Miradouro da Senhora do Monte. Bring wine and snacks.\n\n## Practical Tips\n\n- Lisbon is *hilly*—wear comfortable shoes\n- Trams and metro are easy to use\n- Learn basic Portuguese phrases (locals appreciate the effort)\n- Many places are cash-only\n- Summer gets hot—bring sunscreen\n\n## What I Learned\n\nLisbon has a beautiful melancholy to it—especially in the *fado* music and the way locals talk about *saudade* (a uniquely Portuguese word for nostalgic longing). It's a city that looks both backward and forward, honoring its maritime history while embracing modern creativity.\n\nWould I go back? Absolutely. Two days barely scratched the surface.","src/content/articles/travel/weekend-in-lisbon.md","3bdfeefcdeebadf8",{"html":667,"metadata":668},"\u003Ch1 id=\"a-weekend-guide-to-lisbon\">A Weekend Guide to Lisbon\u003C/h1>\n\u003Cp>Lisbon surprised me.
