# Reflections on Minimalism

Two years ago, I read *The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up* and fell down the minimalism rabbit hole. Here's what I've learned about living with less.

## What Minimalism Isn't

Let's clear up some misconceptions:

- It's **not** about owning exactly 100 things
- It's **not** about having bare white walls and no furniture
- It's **not** about deprivation or suffering
- It's **not** a moral superiority contest

Minimalism is simply being intentional about what you own and why.

## The Decluttering Process

I started with the KonMari method—going through every item and asking "Does this spark joy?" It sounds cheesy, but it works.

#### What I Learned:

- I owned *so much* stuff I didn't use or even like
- Sentimental items are the hardest to let go
- Donating feels better than throwing away
- The first purge is never the last one

After the initial declutter, I donated **15 bags** of clothes, books, kitchen items, and random stuff. My apartment felt lighter immediately.

## The Benefits

Living with less has given me:

- **Physical space** - my apartment feels bigger
- **Mental clarity** - less visual clutter means less mental clutter
- **Easier cleaning** - fewer things to clean and organize
- **Better purchases** - I'm more intentional about what I buy
- **Financial savings** - buying less means spending less

## The Challenges

Minimalism isn't always easy:

- Friends and family don't always understand
- Gift-giving occasions get complicated
- It's ongoing work, not a one-time project
- Consumer culture constantly pushes back

## Finding My Version

I've realized that minimalism is personal. My version includes:

- Keeping books (lots of books)
- Having quality kitchen equipment
- Maintaining hobbies that require stuff (pottery, photography)

The goal isn't to own as little as possible—it's to own *what matters to me* and nothing more.

## Would I Recommend It?

If you feel overwhelmed by your stuff, if cleaning feels never-ending, if you can't find things when you need them—yes, try it.

Start small. Pick one drawer, one shelf, one category. See how it feels. You might surprise yourself.
