# How I Organize My Reading List

I used to have books scattered across multiple apps, browser tabs, notes files, and Amazon wishlists. Finding this system has changed everything.

## The Problem

My old approach was chaotic:

- Goodreads "Want to Read" shelf with 300+ books
- Random notes in my phone
- Browser bookmarks I never looked at
- Recommendations I'd immediately forget

I was *collecting* books, not actually reading them.

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

## My Current System

Still working on this post—will include:

- How I categorize books (fiction vs non-fiction, priority levels)
- My "TBR rotation" concept
- Tools I use
- How I decide what to read next

More details coming soon...
