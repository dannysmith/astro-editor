# Why I Finally Deleted Social Media

Three months ago, I deleted Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook from my phone. A month later, I deleted the accounts entirely. Here's why I did it—and what happened next.

## The Breaking Point

It wasn't one dramatic moment. It was the accumulated weight of thousands of small moments:

- Reaching for my phone the instant I felt bored
- Scrolling through Instagram while talking to my partner
- Feeling inadequate after seeing everyone's highlight reels
- Losing entire evenings to mindless scrolling
- Checking notifications obsessively throughout the day

One morning, I woke up and immediately opened Instagram *before even getting out of bed*. That's when I realized: **I had a problem.**

## The Justifications I Told Myself

For months, I made excuses for why I *couldn't* quit:

> "I need it for work networking"

Did I really? Or was that just a convenient excuse?

> "I'll miss out on important updates from friends"

The friends who matter know how to reach me.

> "I'll be disconnected from current events"

I can read the news without doomscrolling Twitter.

Every justification fell apart under scrutiny. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit.

## What Changed

The first week was hard. I reached for my phone constantly, muscle memory taking over. But then things started to shift:

### Week 1-2: Withdrawal
- Phantom notification anxiety
- Boredom I didn't know how to fill
- FOMO about what I was missing

### Week 3-4: Adjustment
- Started reading books again
- Actually *present* in conversations
- Less comparison and envy

### Month 2-3: Clarity
- More creative output
- Better sleep
- Genuine connections with fewer people
- *Time*—so much time

## What I Learned

Social media isn't inherently evil, but the business model is toxic. These platforms are *designed* to be addictive. They profit from your attention, and they're very good at taking it.

Some observations:

- **I don't miss it.** Not even a little.
- **Real friendships** require more effort, but they're deeper
- **Boredom is valuable**—it's when creativity happens
- **The world didn't end** when I logged off

## What About Professional Networking?

I was worried about losing professional connections, but it turned out fine. I:

- Updated my website with contact information
- Joined specific communities (Slack groups, Discord servers)
- Focused on quality relationships over quantity

These connections are more intentional and valuable than the shallow "networking" I did on social media.

## Should You Quit?

I don't know. Everyone's relationship with social media is different. But if you're reading this and feeling a pang of recognition—if you suspect your usage might be unhealthy—maybe try an experiment:

- [ ] Delete apps from your phone for one week
- [ ] See how you feel
- [ ] Notice where you automatically reach for your phone
- [ ] Pay attention to your mental state

After a week, you'll know whether it's worth continuing.

For me, deleting social media was one of the best decisions I've made for my mental health. I have my attention back. I have my time back. I have *myself* back.

And I'm not going back.
