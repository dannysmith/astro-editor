# The Art of Slow Mornings

For years, I started every day the same way: jolting awake to an alarm, immediately checking my phone, rushing through breakfast, and arriving at work already stressed. Then I discovered the concept of *slow mornings*, and everything changed.

## What Is a Slow Morning?

A slow morning isn't about having endless time—it's about being **intentional** with the time you have. It means:

- Waking up without immediately reaching for your phone
- Taking time to actually *taste* your coffee
- Moving through your morning routine with presence rather than urgency
- Creating space for activities that nourish you

## My Morning Routine

Here's what my current morning looks like:

1. **6:00 AM** - Wake up naturally (no alarm)
2. **6:15 AM** - Meditation and stretching
3. **6:30 AM** - Coffee and journaling
4. **7:00 AM** - Reading or writing
5. **7:30 AM** - Breakfast
6. **8:00 AM** - Start work

The key is that none of these feel rushed. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur.

### The First Hour

The first hour after waking is sacred. I don't check email, I don't look at social media, I don't turn on the news. This hour belongs to *me*, not to the world's demands.

## Changes I've Noticed

Since adopting slow mornings three months ago:

- I feel **calmer throughout the day**
- My productivity has actually *increased*
- I'm more creative and focused
- I look forward to mornings instead of dreading them

## Tips for Starting

You don't need to overhaul your entire life. Start small:

- Wake up just **15 minutes earlier**
- Pick *one* slow activity (meditation, journaling, reading)
- Keep your phone in another room overnight
- Prepare what you can the night before

Remember: this isn't about perfection. Some mornings will be rushed, and that's okay. The goal is to make slow mornings the norm rather than the exception.

## The Bigger Picture

In our culture of hustle and productivity, slow mornings feel almost *rebellious*. But starting your day with intention rather than reaction is one of the most powerful changes you can make.

As the saying goes: *"How you do anything is how you do everything."* When you start your day slowly and intentionally, that energy carries through your entire day.
