# Managing Morning Anxiety

For years, I'd wake up with my heart racing and a knot in my stomach. Before I even opened my eyes, anxiety was already sitting on my chest, making demands.

If you experience morning anxiety, you're not alone. Here's what's helped me.

## Understanding Morning Anxiety

**Cortisol** (the stress hormone) naturally peaks in the morning—it's what wakes us up. But for some people, this spike triggers anxiety symptoms:

- Racing thoughts
- Physical tension
- Sense of dread
- Difficulty getting out of bed

For me, it felt like waking up *already behind*, like I'd forgotten something important even though nothing was actually wrong.

## What Didn't Work

Before I found strategies that helped, I tried things that made it worse:

- Immediately checking my phone (hello, information overload)
- Lying in bed ruminating (amplifies anxious thoughts)
- Caffeinating heavily (more stress hormones)
- Rushing through my morning (validates the "behind" feeling)

## What Actually Helps

### 1. The 5-Minute Rule

I don't *have* to feel better immediately. I just have to get through the next five minutes. Usually, anxiety peaks within 10-15 minutes of waking, then naturally subsides. Knowing this helps me ride it out.

### 2. Physical Grounding

The moment I wake up, I do a **body scan**:

- Notice where tension lives (jaw, shoulders, stomach)
- Take five deep breaths
- Stretch or do gentle movement

This interrupts the anxious thought spiral by anchoring me in my body.

### 3. Morning Pages

I write three pages of stream-of-consciousness thoughts. This *externalizes* the anxiety instead of letting it loop in my head. I don't read what I wrote—it's just a brain dump.

### 4. No Phone for the First Hour

This was hard at first, but it's been transformative. My anxiety feeds on information and urgency. The first hour of my day now belongs to *me*, not to the world's demands.

### 5. Predictable Routine

I do the same things every morning:

- Wake at the same time
- Drink water
- Write morning pages
- Meditate for 10 minutes
- Make breakfast

The predictability is calming. My nervous system knows what to expect.

## Progress, Not Perfection

Some mornings I still wake up anxious. But now:

- I *expect* it might happen
- I have tools to manage it
- I know it will pass
- I don't panic about panicking

The difference between now and two years ago is night and day. Morning anxiety doesn't control my life anymore.

## When to Seek Help

If morning anxiety is severe or persistent, **talk to a therapist**. These strategies have helped me, but they're not a substitute for professional support. There's no shame in needing help—I've been in therapy for years.

## Final Thoughts

You don't have to wake up dreading the day. With the right strategies and support, mornings can become peaceful instead of panic-inducing.

If you experience morning anxiety, what helps you? I'd love to hear what's worked for others.
