# Lessons from Learning Pottery at 35

Six months ago, I walked into a pottery studio for the first time. I'd never touched clay before, never used a pottery wheel, and had no idea what I was doing. Today, I have a shelf full of wonky bowls and mugs—and I've learned more than just how to center clay.

## Why Pottery?

Honestly, it was random. I saw a "[beginner pottery class](https://example.com/pottery)" poster at a coffee shop and signed up on impulse. I was looking for a creative outlet that didn't involve screens, and pottery seemed... different.

## Lesson 1: Failure Is Part of the Process

My first attempt at throwing a bowl collapsed into a sad, lopsided mess within thirty seconds. My second attempt wasn't much better. Neither was my tenth.

In pottery, you fail *constantly*. Clay collapses. Rims crack. Handles break off. Pieces explode in the kiln. But here's the thing: **every failure teaches you something**.

### What Pottery Taught Me About Failure:

- Failure isn't personal—it's data
- You learn more from failures than successes
- The goal isn't perfection; it's improvement
- Starting over is often faster than trying to fix mistakes

## Lesson 2: Patience Is a Skill, Not a Personality Trait

I am not a patient person. I want results *now*. But pottery doesn't work that way.

After throwing a pot, you must:

1. Let it dry to leather-hard (1-2 days)
2. Trim and refine it
3. Let it dry completely (3-5 days)
4. Bisque fire it (8-10 hours)
5. Glaze it
6. Glaze fire it (8-10 hours)
7. Wait for the kiln to cool (12+ hours)

From start to finish, a simple mug takes **two weeks minimum**. You cannot rush it. The clay doesn't care about your deadline.

## Lesson 3: The Process Matters More Than the Product

I used to be obsessed with outcomes. If something didn't turn out perfectly, I considered it a waste of time. Pottery has slowly rewired that thinking.

*The process* of centering clay, feeling it take shape under your hands, solving problems as they arise—that's where the value is. The finished mug is just a bonus.

## Lesson 4: Comparison Kills Joy

In my pottery class, there's a woman who's been throwing for twenty years. Her pots are gorgeous—thin-walled, perfectly symmetrical, with elegant handles. When I first started, I couldn't help comparing my work to hers.

Then my instructor said something that stuck with me: *"The only comparison that matters is between you today and you last month."*

Now I keep my first wonky bowl on my desk as a reminder of how far I've come.

## Lesson 5: Mastery Takes Time (And That's Okay)

Pottery has given me a new appreciation for mastery. I watch experienced potters throw a bowl in five minutes—something that takes me thirty minutes and multiple attempts. That gap used to frustrate me.

Now I see it as exciting. I have *years* of growth ahead of me. Every session at the wheel, I get a little better. The journey toward mastery is long, and that's what makes it worthwhile.

## Why I'm Sharing This

If you've been thinking about learning something new—pottery, painting, piano, whatever—this is your sign to start. Don't worry about being good at it. Don't worry about your age or your lack of experience.

Just start. Make bad things. Learn. Improve. Enjoy the process.

I'm 35 years old, and I'm a terrible potter. I couldn't be happier about it.
