# A Weekend Guide to Lisbon

Lisbon surprised me. I expected beautiful architecture and good food—and it delivered on both—but I wasn't prepared for how *charming* this city is. The hills, the trams, the tiles, the melancholy *fado* music drifting from restaurant windows at night.

## Day 1: Historic Neighborhoods

### Morning: Alfama District

Start in **Alfama**, Lisbon's oldest neighborhood. Get lost (intentionally) in the narrow cobblestone streets. Key spots:

- São Jorge Castle for panoramic views
- Miradouro de Santa Luzia viewpoint
- National Pantheon

### Afternoon: Baixa and Chiado

Take Tram 28 (yes, it's touristy, but worth it) to the **Baixa** district. Walk through:

1. Praça do Comércio - grand waterfront square
2. Rua Augusta - pedestrian shopping street
3. Elevador de Santa Justa - iconic lift with city views

### Evening: Bairro Alto

**Bairro Alto** comes alive at night. Have dinner at a traditional Portuguese restaurant (I recommend trying *bacalhau*—salted cod), then bar hop through the neighborhood's tiny establishments.

## Day 2: Belém and Beyond

### Morning: Belém

Take the tram to **Belém** along the river. Must-sees:

- Jerónimos Monastery (UNESCO World Heritage site)
- Belém Tower
- Padrão dos Descobrimentos (Monument to the Discoveries)

**Important**: Stop at Pastéis de Belém for the original *pastel de nata* (custard tart). There will be a line. It's worth it.

### Afternoon: LX Factory

Head to **LX Factory**, a hipster creative space in an old industrial complex. Great for:

- Shopping for Portuguese design
- Lunch at trendy cafés
- Instagram-worthy bookstores

### Evening: Sunset at Miradouro

End your trip watching sunset from one of Lisbon's many **miradouros** (viewpoints). My favorite: Miradouro da Senhora do Monte. Bring wine and snacks.

## Practical Tips

- Lisbon is *hilly*—wear comfortable shoes
- Trams and metro are easy to use
- Learn basic Portuguese phrases (locals appreciate the effort)
- Many places are cash-only
- Summer gets hot—bring sunscreen

## What I Learned

Lisbon has a beautiful melancholy to it—especially in the *fado* music and the way locals talk about *saudade* (a uniquely Portuguese word for nostalgic longing). It's a city that looks both backward and forward, honoring its maritime history while embracing modern creativity.

Would I go back? Absolutely. Two days barely scratched the surface.
