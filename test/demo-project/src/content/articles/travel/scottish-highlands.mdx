# A Weekend in the Scottish Highlands

Last month, I spent a long weekend in the Scottish Highlands, and it was exactly what my soul needed. No phone service, no emails, just mountains, lochs, and endless skies.

## Getting There

We flew into **Inverness** and picked up a rental car. The drive itself is part of the experience—winding roads through increasingly dramatic landscapes.

<Callout type="info">
Pro tip: Rent a car with good clearance. Highland roads can be rough, and many of the best spots require driving on single-track roads.

## Day 1: Glen Coe

Our first stop was **Glen Coe**, one of the most dramatic valleys in Scotland. The mountains rise steeply on both sides, creating this otherworldly atmosphere—especially in the morning mist.

### Things to Do in Glen Coe:

- Hike the Pap of Glencoe (moderate difficulty)
- Visit the Glen Coe Visitor Centre
- Drive the scenic route through the valley
- Stop at the Three Sisters viewpoint

## Day 2: Isle of Skye

The Isle of Skye exceeded every expectation. We hit the major spots:

1. **The Fairy Pools** - crystal clear water and stunning views
2. **Old Man of Storr** - iconic rock formation (be prepared for crowds)
3. **Quiraing** - dramatic mountain pass with hiking trails
4. **Neist Point** - lighthouse on dramatic cliffs

The weather changes *constantly* on Skye. Bring layers and waterproof gear, even if it looks sunny when you leave!

### Where We Stayed

We found a cozy B&B in Portree, the main town on Skye. The host made incredible Scottish breakfast, and the view from our room looked straight out over the harbor.

## Day 3: Fort William and Loch Ness

On our way back, we stopped at:

- **Fort William** for lunch and supplies
- **Loch Ness** (yes, we looked for Nessie—no sightings)
- **Urquhart Castle** on the shores of the loch

## What I Learned

The Highlands reminded me why I travel: to feel small in the best way possible. Standing at the base of those ancient mountains, watching mist roll through the valleys, I felt *perspective* click back into place.

## Practical Tips

Here's what I wish I'd known:

- **Midges** (tiny biting insects) are brutal in summer. Bring insect repellent.
- Gas stations are few and far between—fill up when you can
- Many restaurants close early, especially in small villages
- The sun doesn't set until 10 PM in summer (amazing for photography!)

Would I go back? In a heartbeat. There's something about the Highlands that stays with you long after you leave.
