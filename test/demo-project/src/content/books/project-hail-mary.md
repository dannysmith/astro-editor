# Project Hail Mary

If you loved *The Martian*, you'll love this too. Andy Weir has once again created a science-heavy, problem-solving adventure that's impossible to put down.

## The Setup

Ryland Grace wakes up on a spaceship with no memory of how he got there. Slowly, he pieces together that he's on a desperate mission to save humanity from extinction. The Earth is dying, and he's humanity's last hope.

### What Works

The **problem-solving** is addictive. Like *The Martian*, watching Grace work through seemingly impossible challenges using science and ingenuity is thrilling. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

The friendship that develops in the second half (no spoilers!) is genuinely touching and provides emotional depth beyond the hard science.

### The Science

Weir doesn't dumb things down, but he makes complex concepts accessible through Grace's teaching background. You'll learn about:

- Astrophysics and stellar evolution
- Xenobiology
- Orbital mechanics
- Chemistry and molecular bonds

## Final Verdict

A thrilling space adventure with heart. Not quite as tight as *The Martian*, but still a fantastic read that kept me up way too late on multiple nights. **Solid 4/5 stars**.
