# The Midnight Library

## A Story About Infinite Possibilities

Between life and death, there exists a magical library where every book represents a different version of your life. This is the premise of Matt Haig's *The Midnight Library*, and it's absolutely captivating.

### What I Loved

The concept is brilliant: **Nora Seed** finds herself in this mystical library after attempting suicide, and she can experience all the lives she might have lived if she'd made different choices. Each book shows her a parallel universe where she made different decisions.
