# The Thursday Murder Club

Still working on this review, but initial thoughts: absolutely delightful cozy mystery featuring four retirees who meet weekly to investigate cold cases.

## Quick Notes

- The characters are wonderful—each member of the club is distinct and lovable
- The mystery is clever without being too convoluted
- Perfect blend of humor and genuine intrigue
- The voice is warm and inviting
