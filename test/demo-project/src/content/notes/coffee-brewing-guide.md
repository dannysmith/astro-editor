# Coffee Brewing Guide

Found this incredibly detailed guide to pour-over coffee. The author is clearly obsessed (in a good way).

## The Basics

Pour-over coffee is all about **control**:

1. Water temperature (195-205°F)
2. Grind size (medium-fine)
3. Pour rate and pattern
4. Coffee-to-water ratio

The guide breaks down each variable and explains how it affects extraction.

### Equipment Needed

- Pour-over dripper (V60, Chemex, etc.)
- Gooseneck kettle
- Burr grinder
- Scale
- Timer

## The Technique

The article describes a **three-pour method**:

1. **Bloom** - wet grounds, wait 30-45 seconds
2. **Main pour** - slow, circular motions
3. **Final pour** - finish to desired weight

Total brew time should be 2.5-3.5 minutes.

Need to try this method tomorrow morning and see if I can actually taste the difference.
