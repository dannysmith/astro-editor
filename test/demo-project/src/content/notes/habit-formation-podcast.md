# Great Podcast on Habit Formation

Just listened to this fantastic podcast episode on the psychology of habits. Key takeaways:

## Main Points

- **Identity-based habits** work better than outcome-based habits
- Small wins create momentum
- Environment design is *crucial*
- Habit stacking: attach new habits to existing ones

The host interviewed a neuroscientist who explained how habits form in the brain. Fascinating stuff about neural pathways and repetition.

### Quote I Loved

> "You don't need more motivation. You need better systems."

Definitely adding this to my regular rotation. The whole series on behavioral psychology looks promising.
