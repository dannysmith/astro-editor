# Quote from Atomic Habits

This quote has been stuck in my head since I read it:

> "You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems."

— James Clear, *Atomic Habits*

It's such a simple idea but it reframes everything. Stop obsessing over goals and start building better systems.

If you want to:

- **Write more** → Build a system for daily writing
- **Get fit** → Build a system for regular exercise
- **Learn something** → Build a system for consistent practice

The goal is just a direction. The system is what gets you there.
