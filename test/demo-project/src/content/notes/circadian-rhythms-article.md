# Circadian Rhythms Article

This article blew my mind. Turns out our circadian rhythms control way more than just sleep:

- **Metabolism** - when we digest food most efficiently
- **Hormone production** - cortisol peaks in the morning, melatonin at night
- **Body temperature** - varies throughout the day
- **Cognitive performance** - peak times for different types of tasks

## Key Insights

Your body has an internal clock that runs on roughly a 24-hour cycle. Light is the primary signal that keeps it synchronized, but eating and exercise also play roles.

### Practical Applications

- Get **morning sunlight** to anchor your circadian rhythm
- Avoid **bright light** (especially blue light) before bed
- Eat your **largest meal** earlier in the day
- **Exercise** at consistent times

The article explains why jet lag is so brutal—you're fighting against millions of years of evolution.

Worth bookmarking for later reference.
