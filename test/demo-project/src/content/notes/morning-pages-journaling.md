# Morning Pages Journaling

Trying out **morning pages** from *The Artist's Way*. The concept: write three pages longhand, first thing every morning, stream-of-consciousness style.

## The Rules

- Three pages, no more, no less
- Longhand only (no typing)
- Do it *first thing* in the morning
- Don't read what you wrote
- No editing, no censoring

## My Experience So Far

Two weeks in and I'm noticing:

- My mind feels clearer throughout the day
- I'm working through problems without realizing it
- The act of writing slows my racing thoughts
- It's meditative in a weird way

Some mornings I have *nothing* to say and just write "I don't know what to write" repeatedly. That's apparently fine—the point is just to keep the pen moving.

Might not be for everyone, but it's working for me so far.
