# One-Pot Pasta Primavera

Found this recipe and made it three times already. So easy and actually tasty!

<Callout type="info">
**Ingredients:**
- 12 oz pasta (any shape)
- 2 cups mixed vegetables (bell peppers, zucchini, cherry tomatoes)
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 4 cups vegetable broth
- 1/2 cup parmesan
- Fresh basil
- Salt, pepper, red pepper flakes
</Callout>

## Instructions

1. Combine everything except parmesan in a large pot
2. Bring to boil, then simmer for 10-12 minutes
3. Stir in parmesan
4. Top with fresh basil

The key is using *good* vegetable broth. Store-bought is fine but homemade is better.

**Pro tip:** Add the vegetables in stages based on cooking time. Hard veggies (carrots) first, delicate ones (spinach) last.
