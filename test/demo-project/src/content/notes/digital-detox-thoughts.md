# Thoughts on Digital Detox

Been thinking about taking a proper digital detox. Not just "less phone time" but actually unplugging for a week or two.

## What This Would Look Like

- No phone (or phone in airplane mode)
- No computer beyond absolute work necessities
- No TV/streaming
- Maybe even no music?

The idea both excites and terrifies me. What would I even *do* with all that time?

Read? Walk? Think? Stare at walls?

## Why I'm Hesitant

- FOMO
- Work obligations
- Worried I'll be bored
- What if there's an emergency?

But also: maybe boredom is the point? Maybe I need to rediscover what it's like to just... be?

Still thinking this through...
