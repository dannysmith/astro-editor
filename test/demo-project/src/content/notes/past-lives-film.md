# Film Recommendation: Past Lives

Watched this last night and I'm still thinking about it. It's a Korean-American film about childhood friends who reconnect as adults after 20 years.

## Why It Works

The film is *quiet*—long silences, lingering shots, minimal dialogue. But every frame is packed with emotion. It's about:

- The sliding doors moments of life
- Paths not taken
- Connection across time and distance
- The immigrant experience
- "In-yun" (인연) - the Korean concept of fate bringing people together

### The Performances

All three leads are phenomenal, but **Greta Lee** carries this film. She communicates so much with just her face—the weight of choices made and unmade.

## Themes I'm Still Processing

- What do we owe to our past selves?
- Can you have multiple "right" people?
- How do we reconcile who we were with who we became?

Not an action-packed film, but it will **wreck you** emotionally. Bring tissues.

**Rating:** 5/5 - Will be thinking about this one for a long time.
