notes collection schema.\n\n## Schema Fields Tested\n\n### Required Fields ✅\n- **title**: String field (required)\n- **pubDate**: Date field (required)\n\n### Optional Fields ✅\n- **slug**: Custom URL slug\n- **description**: Longer description for SEO/previews\n- **sourceURL**: External link to source material\n- **tags**: Array of categorization tags\n- **draft**: Boolean flag for draft status\n- **styleguide**: Boolean flag for styleguide content\n\n## Source Material\n\nThis note references external content via the `sourceURL` field, which is useful for:\n\n1. **Link blogs**: Commenting on external articles\n2. **Reference notes**: Quick thoughts about other content\n3. **Research notes**: Tracking source materials\n4. **Bookmarks**: Enhanced bookmarking with commentary\n\n## Content Types\n\nNotes can contain various markdown elements:\n\n### Lists\n- Quick bullet points\n- Simple thoughts\n- Reference links\n\n### Quotes\n> \"Notes should capture thoughts quickly without heavy formatting requirements\"\n\n### Simple Code\nUse `inline code` for quick technical references.\n\n```bash\n# Quick command references\nnpm run dev\n```\n\n## Testing Expectations\n\nThis note should:\n\n1. **Show draft badge** (draft: true)\n2. **Display all form fields** when editing\n3. **Handle optional fields** properly\n4. **Validate sourceURL** as proper URL\n5. **Support tag management** with add/remove functionality\n6. **Maintain schema compliance** during editing\n\nThe notes collection is designed for simpler, quicker content capture compared to full articles, but should still support rich frontmatter when needed.","src/content/notes/1708123456789-comprehensive-note-schema-test.md","c8fcb55abe46927b",{"html":301,"metadata":302},"\u003Ch1
